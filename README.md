# BFS_DP_Functions

This repository contains Python implementations of various classic problems in algorithms, focusing on graph traversal, dynamic programming, and optimization techniques. It's designed to help understand key principles of computer science and algorithm design.

## Content

- **BFS_Length.py**: Implements the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path and distance between two vertices in a graph.
- **DP_Programming.py**: Demonstrates different dynamic programming techniques to solve problems such as the unbounded knapsack problem, weighted interval scheduling, stock trading for maximum profit, and counting ways to make change.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need Python 3.x installed on your system to run these scripts. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation
